## Stage 0 — Agent workflow setup

**Status:** Done

**Shipped:**
- `AGENTS.md` — repo conventions, commands, workflow rules, boundaries
- `docs/spec-template.md` — lightweight spec format for non-trivial changes
- `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md` — read-only review subagent
- `.gitignore` — Nx/Next.js/pnpm/Cloudflare-aware

**Decisions:**
- Monorepo via Nx, but **manual** app/package scaffolding — Nx used for task orchestration/caching, not its generators
- Shared packages (`packages/common`, `packages/ui`) stay lean — only promote a dependency there if 2+ apps need it
- Agent workflow: single agent for plan + implement (mode-switching), separate `code-reviewer` subagent for independent review before PR
- Backend approach: no CMS/DB by default — starts as a contact-form endpoint (Resend or similar), real DB (Postgres/D1) only added when a specific pet project (e.g. auth practice) needs it
- One branch per change, PR to `main`, no direct commits to `main`

**Next:** Stage 1 — Nx workspace + portfolio app scaffolding (see `docs/specs/001-nx-workspace-scaffolding.md`)
